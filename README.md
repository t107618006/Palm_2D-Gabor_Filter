# Palm_2D-Gabor_Filter
This code is part of the Gabor Filter program used in the Journal: 
Palm vein recognition scheme based on an adaptive Gabor filter

The program also contains another method for extracting the maximal ROI.

You can use "2D_Gabor_mian.cpp" for the main program and add other code to resourec and head file.

After the process,hte program will extraction two type of feature.We call the real part and imaginary part.
